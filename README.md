# DS3 Memory Reader
A simple console application for reading player coordinates in real time from a Dark Souls III process. Make sure you target x64. You may need to run Visual Studio as an administrator for this to work correctly.

Offsets and addresses are taken from [this DS3 Cheat Table](https://github.com/igromanru/Dark-Souls-III-Cheat-Engine-Guide). It looks like most of the values displayed in the table can be read using the code in this repository.
